While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual issue where the application would crash intermittently during runtime without providing any specific error messages in the console. The crashes were inconsistent, occurring at seemingly random points within the application's workflow.  This made debugging extremely challenging.  I've tried standard debugging techniques, including console logs, but the crashes happened without any warning.
