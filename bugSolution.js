The intermittent crashes were eventually traced to a race condition within an asynchronous function that was not properly handling potential errors. The solution involved adding comprehensive error handling within the asynchronous function using try...catch blocks, and ensuring proper cleanup of resources to prevent resource leaks.  This enhanced error handling allowed the application to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios and prevent the crashes.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('some_url');
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    // ... process data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    // Implement appropriate error handling, e.g., display a user-friendly message
  } finally{
    //Clean up any resources
  }
}
```

Adding this more robust error handling, along with a careful review of the asynchronous operations, solved the crashes.
